QOR is a software suite aimed to assist in online business success.

QOR is architected from the ground up to accelerate development and deployment of Content Management Systems (CMS), E-Commerce systems (EC), and business applications. QOR is comprised of modules that abstract common features for such systems, such as: a configurable and flexible back office; a content publishing system; a media library; and much more.

Typically, a QOR-based system will revolve around QOR Admin, which is the CMS component. QOR Admin facilitates easy database and media content management and is not bound to a single database technology.

The bulk of QOR's multifaceted capabilities lie in the Plugins, they can be used independantly but their super-powers shine when used together. Many of the plugins utilise GORM, but it is possible to utilise any other ORM if need be.

We, The Plant, utilise QOR on our own projects and are interested to hear about yours and your experience in using QOR - there are a number of ways to contibute and communicate with us and the QOR community:
